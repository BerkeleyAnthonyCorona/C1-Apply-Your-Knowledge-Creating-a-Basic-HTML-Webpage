<p>Welcome to my Website!</p>

<p>Planning a website requires you to not only know your audience,
 but also to make it easy to use and understand. Optimzation is also a biggie, since many
 people will be able to access your website from different devices. Using a site map would also be
beneficial, allowing you to further plan ahead and telegraph which links lead to where.
Little things like fonts and colors for the text can also help, despite not seeming so
crucial to the website. Interestingly enough, they can invoke emotion as well as
allow people to get a sense of familiarity and attach emotions or ideas to certain
pieces of text on your site.
    To sum up chapter 1 of the e-text, we are first introduced to terms such as networks and nodes,
which both are refering to the connection of computers as well as devices in general that connect to
the internet. We are also educated about the ins and outs of a browser, given a more indepth look
about certain commands. And for a good amount of the chapter, we are given a look on the websites,
and how they vary from different types to how they work on different devices.</p>
